== Installation
Currently the project is in pre-alpha phase. So no releases yet.
I am planning to make APK releases here in github and I will try to add the app the fdroid store.

== Usage
1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Use the search bar to look for specific Pokemon cards by name,
3. Browse through the search results and tap on a card to view its details.

== Architecture Notes

=== ECB Pattern


The Entity-Control-Boundary (ECB) pattern is a design pattern that aids in organizing code by separating it into three distinct types of classes: Entities, Controls, and Boundaries. This separation helps to clarify the roles and responsibilities of different parts of the code, making it easier to manage, understand, and maintain. Originating from the field of object-oriented design, the ECB pattern can be particularly effective in the context of Android app development, where the complexity of applications can quickly grow.

==== Components of the ECB Pattern

*Entities:*
- Represent the core business logic and data.
- Encapsulate the data and the rules that govern access to and updates of this data.
- In an Android context, these are often model classes representing the data structure of the app.

*Control:*
- Orchestrate the flow of the application.
- Manage the sequences of interactions between the Entities and Boundaries.
- Typically implemented as ViewModels, Presenters, or Controllers in Android apps.

*Boundary:*
- Define the interfaces through which the system interacts with the outside world (e.g., user interfaces, network services).
- Handle input and output operations.
- In Android apps, these are often Activities, Fragments, or Services that deal with the user interface and user interactions.

=== NO clean architecture

It is my very own personal opionion but I simply don't like the so called "clean architecture" package structure which is commonly used in most android apps. I think the ECB pattern is much _cleaner_ and fits the Keep-it-simple-stupid paradigmatic.
